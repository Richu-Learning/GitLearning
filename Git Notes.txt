Git is free and open source.

its a version control system   - > it means when multiple ppl working on same project for tracking the changes version
control system is used.

GitHub is centralized space where repo is belong and everyone put their code to this centralized Repo to collaborte each other.

For getting  a copy  of  a repo we need to Fork it.  doing in github itself

Clone the repo means it become  local repo ie in our system   . doing in our local system

SSH KEY SETUP:
ssh key is created for security/privacy when we pusing or pull from the github account.  
my file saved here by defult/utomticlly: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa

Command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C richuanivelil@gmail.com

ssh agent also need to be created, we need to add the ssh key to the agent.

Command for create agent:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Eg:
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 1159 
Agent created and running at port 1159  

Now add the the key to agent 

Command:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Eg:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Identity added: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa (richuanivelil@gmail.com)

Later add this value from id_rsa mp file from our local to github account in settings -> add ssh key


git init -> command is used to initilize our local directory as a local git repo.  ie working area.   it will have .git folder if we want to check
			if it is a working area or not.

git status -> command is used to check the uncommited/untracked changes happens to our local repo since last commit  {it will show the file names tht edited,  git diff will show content}.

git add . ->  command is used to make all files tracked.{Stage area/staged files}

git commit -m "message" -> command is used to save all the changes added. before pushing we have to commit our changes.

git remote add origin "path from github"  -> used to set the target repo of our push.

git remote -v  -> command for verifiying the push and pull path by displaying.

git push -u origin master  -> command is for push the changes to repo.

git clone "repourl"  -> command is for download the code from another repo to our local repo.

git clone "repourl"  -> command is for download the code from another repo to our local repo.

git remote add upstream "upstreamrepourl" -> command to set upstream (up[stream is where the updated code si/ the main repo).

git diff  -> command shows the difference made in our working area.

git restore --staged "file name"   --> command used to undo the previos git add {if space in file name use double quotes}

git restore "file name"   -> command used to get the previously commited file ie undo all the changes after last commit on the file.

git commit --amend  -> command to change the last commit message. {it will open a editble file we have to change the message there}.

git log  --> command will show the logs of the enitire commit history.

git pull upstream master  -> command to pull from upstream repo. {main repo we configured}


BRANCHES:

git branch  -> command list all the branches under our main repo.

git branch "branch name"  -> command to create new branch.

git checkout "branchname"  -> commnd to switch to another branch.

git branch -d "branch name"  -> command to delete a branch

git checkout -b "branch name" -> command to create new branch and switch to it.


git push origin --delete "branch name"   -> command to delete branch if we pushed anything to the branch.

After Creating new branch to reflect in git hub we need to push.
git push origin "branch name".






Guidances:

Before pulling from remote repo our local repo should be commited of all the changes.

At organization level we will fork the min repo to our user profile then clone it to the local.
After making/coding we will push the changes to our forked repo.
And to make changes in org repo we will make a pull request/PR's and admin will verify/review our changes and push it to org main repo.


After made changes we need to raise a pull request to merge to main organization repo then authorized person will validte and merge it.

***if plugins not installed we wont get all options*****so make sure all plugins installed before using featurs of it.

Git INtegration with Jenkins:
Poll Scm can used to integrate git with jenkins . 
we can use Webhook in Git{Settings->Webhook->Give URL} to integrate with Jenkins  and checkin the GIthub hooktrigger option in Jenkins



For Building a Maven Project through jenkins
In job configure:
we have to give delete workspace(for avoiding failure by already existing files)  -> in build environment
and in build invoke toplevel maven Targets and mention clean test install after clicking advanced. also mention location of pom.xml

if we using git no need to mention the location of pom.xml in jenkins job or else we need to mention.



For Deploying to tomcat/any server we need to Deploy to container plugin is needed

For Pipeline view we need DeliveryPipeline plugin  and need to create delivery pipeline view

DeliveryPipeline and BuildPipeLine
DeliveryPipeline  ->need  delivery pipeline plugin

BuildPipeLine  -> need Build Pipeline plugin

Apart from other pipelines in jenkins pipeline we dont need to create seperate jobs and connect..here we can mention it as stages in jenkins script file
Jenkins Pipeline:
Scripted and Declrative Pipeline:
Declrative: pipeline tag , can be in jenkins itself or git, use simple groovy
Scripted: node tag, will be in jenkins, use strict groovy


**for parallel exectution we can use "parallel" inside in steps tag

Sample Declrative Scrip:

pipeline {
agent any
	stages{
        stage('Prepration') {
		steps{
                git 'https://github.com/richuandrews/jenkinsjobmaven.git'
				}
            }

           stage('Build') {
		   steps{
               bat 'mvn clean test'
			   }
           }
           stage('Package')
           {
		   steps{
		   input("Do you want to proceed with packaging?")
               bat 'mvn package'
			   }
           }
              stage('Results')
           {
		   steps{
              junit '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'
                archiveArtifacts 'target/*.jar'
				}
           }
		   }

}
