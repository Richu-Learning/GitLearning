Git is free and open source.

its a version control system   - > it means when multiple ppl working on same project for tracking the changes version
control system is used.

GitHub is centralized space where repo is belong and everyone put their code to this centralized Repo to collaborte each other.

For getting  a copy  of  a repo we need to Fork it.  doing in github itself

Clone the repo means it become  local repo ie in our system   . doing in our local system

SSH KEY SETUP:
ssh key is created for security/privacy when we pusing or pull from the github account.  
my file saved here by defult/utomticlly: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa

Command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C richuanivelil@gmail.com

ssh agent also need to be created, we need to add the ssh key to the agent.

Command for create agent:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Eg:
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 1159 
Agent created and running at port 1159  

Now add the the key to agent 

Command:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Eg:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Identity added: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa (richuanivelil@gmail.com)

Later add this value from id_rsa mp file from our local to github account in settings -> add ssh key


git init -> command is used to initilize our local directory as a local git repo.  ie working area.

git status -> command is used to check the uncommited changes happens to our local repo.

git add . ->  command is used to make all files tracked.{Stage area/staged files}

git commit -m "message" -> command is used to save all the changes added. before pushing we have to commit our changes.

git remote add origin "path from github"  -> used to set the target repo of our push.

git remote -v  -> command for verifiying the push and pull path by displaying.

git push -u origin master  -> push the changes to repo.



hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
