Git is free and open source.

its a version control system   - > it means when multiple ppl working on same project for tracking the changes version
control system is used.

GitHub is centralized space where repo is belong and everyone put their code to this centralized Repo to collaborte each other.

For getting  a copy  of  a repo we need to Fork it.  doing in github itself

Clone the repo means it become  local repo ie in our system   . doing in our local system

SSH KEY SETUP:
ssh key is created for security/privacy when we pusing or pull from the github account.  
my file saved here by defult/utomticlly: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa

Command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C richuanivelil@gmail.com

ssh agent also need to be created, we need to add the ssh key to the agent.

Command for create agent:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Eg:
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
Agent pid 1159 
Agent created and running at port 1159  

Now add the the key to agent 

Command:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Eg:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Identity added: /c/Users/Richu Andrews/.ssh/id_rsa (richuanivelil@gmail.com)

Later add this value from id_rsa mp file from our local to github account in settings -> add ssh key


git init -> command is used to initilize our local directory as a local git repo.  ie working area.   it will have .git folder if we want to check
			if it is a working area or not.

git status -> command is used to check the uncommited/untracked changes happens to our local repo since last commit  {it will show the file names tht edited,  git diff will show content}.

git add . ->  command is used to make all files tracked.{Stage area/staged files}

git commit -m "message" -> command is used to save all the changes added. before pushing we have to commit our changes.

git remote add origin "path from github"  -> used to set the target repo of our push.

git remote -v  -> command for verifiying the push and pull path by displaying.

git push -u origin master  -> push the changes to repo.

git clone "repourl"  -> command is for download the code from another repo to our local repo.

git remote add upstream "upstreamrepourl" -> command to set upstream (up[stream is where the updated code si/ the main repo).

git diff  -> command shows the difference made in our working area.

git restore --staged "file name"   --> command used to undo the previos git add {if space in file name use double quotes}

git restore "file name"   -> command used to get the previously commited file ie undo all the changes after last commit on the file.

git commit --amend  -> command to change the last commit message. {it will open a editble file we have to change the message there}.

git log  --> command will show the logs of the enitire commit history.






Guidances:

At organization level we will fork the min repo to our user profile then clone it to the local.
After making/coding we will push the changes to our forked repo.
And to make changes in org repo we will make a pull request/PR's and admin will verify/review our changes and push it to org main repo.
